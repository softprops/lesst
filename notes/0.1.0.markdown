## extraction for great good

This is the first release of a standalone version of [less css](http://lesscss.org/) compiler extracted from the wildly popular, or at least
decently agreeable, [less-sbt](https://github.com/softprops/less-sbt) sbt plugin.

### Changes/Features

- Better error reporting. error reporting is a _feature_

![errors](http://f.cl.ly/items/3n0u0c2H2m440D3r3p2U/errors.png)

- Upgraded to the latest version of less css, currently [1.4.2](https://github.com/less/less.js/releases/tag/v1.4.2)
- Since this library does less than what the less-sbt sbt plugin does, it can do what it does do better.

### Non-Features

- A lack of a out-of-the-box async interface. This release is published for scala versions supporting `scala.concurrent.Future`, which 
makes it trivial to make the async choice yourself. Batteries are now included in the language so they are intentially kept out
of the library.

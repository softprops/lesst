## extraction for great good

This is the first release of a standalone less css compiler extracted from the wildly popular, well 
decently agreeable, less-sbt sbt plugin.

### Changes/Features

- better error reporting. error reporting is a _feature_
- (Beta) support for the upcoming less css 1.4.0 compiler. This is likely to be dropped in the next release.

### Non-Features

- A lack of a out of the box async interface. This release targets scala versions supporting `scala.concurrent.Future`, which 
makes it trivial to make the async choice yourself. Batteries are now included in the language so they are intentially kept out
of the library.

### Planned/Features

- use `scala.util.Try[CompilationResult]` instead of Either. This release targets sbt 0.12.* which is compiled for scala 2.9.2.

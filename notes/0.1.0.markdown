## extraction for great good

This is the first release of a standalone version of [less css](http://lesscss.org/) compiler extracted from the wildly popular, or at least
decently agreeable, [less-sbt](https://github.com/softprops/less-sbt) sbt plugin.

### Changes/Features

- better error reporting. error reporting is a _feature_
- Upgraded to the lasted version of less, currently 1.4.2
- Since it does less that what the sbt plugin needs, it can do what it does do better.

### Non-Features

- A lack of a out of the box async interface. This release targets scala versions supporting `scala.concurrent.Future`, which 
makes it trivial to make the async choice yourself. Batteries are now included in the language so they are intentially kept out
of the library.
